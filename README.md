# Anchor Collector 🦀

A tiny tool that collects stats from [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/).

It's written in Rust, and it was great fun to build.

I use it myself to check stats for my [podcast Ogrodje](https://anchor.fm/ogrodje).

## Usage & Development

```bash
Usage: anchor-collector --email <EMAIL> --password <PASSWORD>

Options:
  -e, --email <EMAIL>
  -p, --password <PASSWORD>
  -h, --help                 Print help information
  -V, --version              Print version information
```

Get the latest Rust and then use cargo to build and run this thing.
